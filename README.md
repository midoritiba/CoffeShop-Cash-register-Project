# CoffeShop Cash Register Project

## Final Project for Programming Basic's Module | WebDevelopment Course - DCI

https://midoritiba.github.io/CoffeShop-Cash-register-Project/

My idea for this project was to develop a simple responsive web application for employees of a small coffee shop to use it as an order/payment record.

The cashier can view all menu items (image, category, name and price), add items to cart, increase, decrease or remove units of each item added. The app will show the total items in the cart, the subtotal price, the value of a 10% tip, and the total price. This Coffee Shop only accepts cash, so after the customer has paid, we can calculate change if necessary. After registering the purchase, we can move on to the next customer.

In this project I tried to apply the following concepts:

- Classes Constructors
- DOM Manipulation
- Array.forEach()
- onClick Event

Our class had 4 days to develop this project. For this exercise I focused more on the Javascript part, as that was the main subject of this module. I tried to implement previous knowledge of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I realize that the css part needs improvement especially for readability and I believe there is some redundant coding as well (my intention is to get back to it :)).
